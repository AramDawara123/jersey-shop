# Jersey's Webshop

Welcome to the Jersey's Webshop project. This is an online e-commerce platform for jersey's products.

## Why Did I Make This Webshop?

1. I made this jerseys webshop because I enjoy working with sports merchandise and i love watching football as well so it seemed like a cool idea.
2. Here is my workflow chart for how the webshop works : [Workflow](https://www.figma.com/board/u5DdZQr6bKKXrI68ryZkYM/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=O8OKj156SU45sDHO-0)
